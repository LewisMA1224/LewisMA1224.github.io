# Markdown Cheatsheet ✍️

This is a paragraph.

# Heading 1  
## Heading 2  
### Heading 3  
#### Heading 4  
##### Heading 5  
###### Heading 6  

Using two asterisks **this text is bold**.  
Two underscores __work as well__.  
Let's make it *italic now*.  
You guessed it, _one underscore is also enough_.  
Can we combine **_both of that_?** Absolutely.  
What if I want to ~~strikethrough~~?

> This is a blockquote.
> Want to write on a new line with space between?
>
> > And nested? No problem at all.

> > > PS. you can **style** your text _as you want_.

# Code Snippets 💻

I created `.env` file at the root.  
Backticks inside backticks? `` `No problem.` ``

```
{
  learning: "Markdown",
  showing: "block code snippet"
}
```

```js
const x = "Block code snippet in JS";
console.log(x);
```

Inline code? `console.log('Hello World');`
