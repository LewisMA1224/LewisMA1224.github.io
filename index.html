<p class="early-life-text">
  I was raised on a quiet farm in Danbury, North Carolina ‚Äî a town so small it didn‚Äôt even have a stoplight. Our days were slow and southern: <span class="highlight">roosters crowed before sunrise</span>, the <span class="glow">barn cats ruled the hay bales</span>, and our bloodhound howled anytime a deer crossed into the yard. I had a country accent thick as molasses, watched <strong>Walker Texas Ranger</strong> religiously, and could spend hours playing Galaga on my old Nintendo 64. I‚Äôd shoot BBs at cans and birds (sorry, birds), and disappear for hours into the woods building forts and damming creeks, pretending I was surviving in the wild. My grandparents lived just up the hill, and I could visit them on foot like it was the 1800s.  
  <br /><br />
  One of my favorite memories is <span class="underline-on-hover">camping with my dad on the Dan River</span>. He caught fish, roasted them on the fire, and told me stories about being on his own at 16, barn-raising, and out-running the law with his wild friends. My dad was all grit and calloused hands ‚Äî the kind of man who could build a barn solo. My mom, on the other hand, was the heart: soft-spoken, nurturing, the kind of woman who made even silence feel warm. That mix of toughness and tenderness shaped who I am.
  <br /><br />
  When I wasn‚Äôt pretending to be a frontiersman, I was go-kart racing, playing football with older kids who didn‚Äôt take it easy on me, and gaming with my best friend Thomas. We'd play Star Wars and Midnight Club 3 for hours, then sprint through the woods or swim at the lake near his house. Danbury was simple ‚Äî but it gave me everything: imagination, resilience, and a love for stories that now fuel the work I create.

      <img src="Images/cow.jpg" alt="cow mascot" class="responsive-img mascot-img">
      <p>
        When I was 15, I didn‚Äôt get a cashier job at Chick-fil-A ‚Äî I got something better: a chance to be the cow. Ross, the owner, said all he had was the mascot spot, and I said, <span class="quote">‚ÄúI'll take it, man!‚Äù</span> I danced on intersections to the Black Eyed Peas, ran sprints in the suit to train for cross-country, and even got honks for every pushup I did in traffic. Kids cried. People laughed. I burned calories in a full cow suit and got paid in sandwiches and milkshakes. The cow became my alter ego ‚Äî part athlete, part menace, full chaos.

      <img src="Images/saura_mascot.gif" alt="High School Mascot" class="responsive-img mascot-img">
      <p>
        At South Stokes High, I wore a costume designed by our art department using beads and plexiglass, backed by funding from my mom‚Äôs company. The ‚ÄúSaura‚Äù honored a local Native American tribe, and I brought it to life ‚Äî charging out with the football team, jumping around at basketball games, and generally causing joyful chaos in hallways and pep rallies. I wasn‚Äôt just in costume ‚Äî I was *hype incarnate.*
      </p>

    <!-- ECU PeeDee -->
    <div class="mascot-block pirate">
      <img src="Images/pee_dee_mascot.jpg" alt="College Mascot" class="responsive-img mascot-img">
      <p>
        College leveled things up: I became PeeDee, the official pirate mascot of East Carolina University. I performed at football, basketball, and volleyball games, traveled to El Paso and Connecticut, and once did the game intro *solo* in front of 50,000 screaming fans when the lead guy got sick. That moment? Electric. But it wasn‚Äôt all glory ‚Äî once I had to do 50 pushups in the suit and ended up flopping like a fish. Still, PeeDee gave me confidence, cool merch, early class registration, and the kind of backstage memories that stick for life.

      <p>
        In 2022, I hit a breaking point ‚Äî 320 pounds, depressed, and running on fumes. I‚Äôd built bad habits trying to survive stress and burnout, but I knew if I wanted to lead in life, love, and tech ‚Äî I had to rebuild from the inside out.
      </p>
      <p>
        I approached weight loss like a system upgrade: with clear inputs, scheduled outputs, and daily execution. No shortcuts. I‚Äôve since lost over <strong>100 pounds</strong>, dropped bad habits, and gained the kind of clarity and confidence you don‚Äôt download ‚Äî you earn.
      </p>

        Today I apply that same level of discipline to my career, coding, and relationships. The grit it takes to wake up at 4AM and train is the same grit I bring to every terminal window, study session, and opportunity I chase.
